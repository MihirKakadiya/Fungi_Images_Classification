# Fungi_Images_Classification
 

1. Introduction:
- Fungi play crucial roles in various industrial processes and ecosystems. However, fungal infections can pose significant challenges, requiring timely diagnosis and   treatment. Traditional diagnosis methods involve manual examinations by mycologists, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this project, we explore     the use of deep learning techniques for automated fungal detection in crops, aiming to streamline the diagnosis process and improve efficiency.

2. Materials and Methods:

- Dataset: We obtained our dataset from the 'UCI Machine Learning Repository', comprising high-resolution images of fungal infections categorized into five classes.
- Data Augmentation: To balance the dataset, we performed data augmentation, increasing the total number of images for each class.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): We employed CNNs, specifically the EfficientNetV2-S model, for image classification tasks.
- Transfer Learning: We utilized transfer learning, fine-tuning the pre-trained EfficientNetV2-S model on our dataset to adapt it to fungal infection detection.
- Experimental Setup: The training process involved monitoring training metrics and employing techniques to prevent overfitting.
  
3. Why Deep Learning and not Traditional Machine Learning Algorithm?

- Feature Learning: Deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data, making them suitable for image classification tasks.
- End-to-End Learning: Deep learning models can learn end-to-end mappings from input to output, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
- Scale and Complexity: Deep learning models can handle the scale and complexity of large datasets more effectively than traditional machine learning algorithms.
  
4. Results:

- We evaluated the performance of our model and compared it with traditional CNNs and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The EfficientNetV2-S model achieved a validation     accuracy of 92.3%, outperforming CNNs and DNNs in accurately classifying fungal infections.
